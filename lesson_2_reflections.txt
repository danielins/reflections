Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates the hidden git folder that controls the changes on the files and stores their data. This folder is what makes git works.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area deals only with the files I want to save and monitor, giving more control and consistency.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By only adding the changes that are related to the staging area.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Making changes, like adding features or testing different approaches to existing ones are examples of situations. Branches separates those changes from the 'official' branch (master).
